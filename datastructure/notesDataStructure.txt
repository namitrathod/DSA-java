Types of programming language
        =>Procedural
                -specifies a series of well structure steps and procedures to compose a program.
                -contain a systematic order of statements, functions and commands to end the task.
        =>Functional
                -writing a program only in pure function (ie never modify variables), but only create new one as an output.
                -used in situation where we have to perform lots of different operations on the set of data, like ml
                - first class functions
        =>Object oriented
                -revolves around objects
                -code + data = object
                -develop to make it easier to debug, develop, reuse, and maintain software.
static and dynamic language
      Static
        -perform type checking at compile time.
        -error will show at compile time
        -declare datatypebefore You use it.
        - more control
      dynamic
        -perform type checking at runtime.
        -error might not show till program is run.
        -no need to declare datatype of variables.
        -Saves time in writing code but might give error at runtime.

Garbage Collection
Garbage collection (GC) is a memory recovery feature built into programming languages such as C# and Java.
 A GC-enabled programming language includes one or more garbage collectors (GC engines) that automatically 
 free up memory space that has been allocated to objects no longer needed by the program. The reclaimed memory 
 space can then be used for future object allocations within that program.

Garbage collection ensures that a program does not exceed its memory quota or reach a point that it can no longer
function. It also frees up developers from having to manually manage a program's memory, which, in turn, reduces
the potential for memory-related bugs.

In older programming languages, such as C and C++, the developer must manually delete objects and free up memory.
Relying on manual processes made it easy to introduce bugs into the code, some of which can have serious consequences.

Sudo Code 
for prime or not 
            start
            input number
            c=2
            while c*c<=number
                if number%c==0
                    output not prime
                    exit
                c = c+1
            end while
            output prime
            exit
